# Hidden Markov Model based Text-to-Speech Synthesis System
A Hidden Markov model based text to speech synthesis system similar to HTS that I implemented in C# as part of my MS thesis. I am in the process of creating documentation. I will upload the files as soon as I add some basic documentation. If you need it urgently you can email me.
